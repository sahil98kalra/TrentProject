Customer Churn Analysis In Telecom Organization 

This source file contains code for predicting customer churn using various machine learning models. Below are the instructions on how to set up and run the code without cloning the repository.

Prerequisites:
-Python 3.x installed on your machine

Required Python libraries:
-pandas
-numpy
-seaborn
-matplotlib
-scikit-learn
-imbalanced-learn
-xgboost
-Steps to Set Up and Run the Code:

Download the Dataset:

Download the Telco Customer Churn dataset ('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn') from here.

Install Required Python Libraries:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Copy code:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost

Copy the Code:
Copy the entire code provided in the source code file.

Paste the Code:
Paste the copied code into a Python script file (e.g., customer_churn_prediction.py) on your local machine.

Run the Python Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Python script file is located.
Run the Python script:

Copy code
python customer_churn_prediction.py

Follow the Instructions:
The script will prompt you to enter binary values (0 or 1) for each feature related to a customer.
Follow the prompts and enter the values accordingly.
After providing input for all features, the script will output the probability of churn for the provided input.
Note: Ensure that the Telco Customer Churn dataset ('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn') is in the same directory as the Python script file.

That's it! You have successfully set up and run the code to predict customer churn using machine learning models without cloning the repository. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out for assistance.
